## Home server in a nutshell

The home server is a desktop computer located at home that provides services for my own convenience and for users who access websites hosted on the server. At the time of writing, the home server is running on Windows 11 Pro, with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Windows Sub-linux system (WSL) on the side. Currently, the home server is running the following services:
